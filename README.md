# VerySimpleGUI-for-MDM
This is very simple GUI for MDM(Human Motion Diffusion Model).

This GUI run on [GuyTevet/motion-diffusion-model](https://github.com/GuyTevet/motion-diffusion-model)

Place GUI.py in the same directory as sample.py

Pre-trained model loading on MDM is very fast, so using subprocess, this GUI only send commands to sample.py.
